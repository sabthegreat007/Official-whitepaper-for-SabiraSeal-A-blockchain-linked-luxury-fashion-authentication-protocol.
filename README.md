**Welcome to the official whitepaper repository for SabiraSeal™**  
A blockchain-anchored authentication protocol for luxury fashion and collectible assets.

## 🧬 What is SabiraSeal™?

SabiraSeal™ is a pioneering card-based authentication format that merges high fashion with blockchain technology.  
Each card links a physical luxury piece (e.g., couture garment, jewelry, collectible) with a unique, immutable digital certificate stored on-chain. This provides verified proof of ownership, origin, and authenticity forever.

It is the first of its kind in the fashion industry.

### 🔐 Powered by Blockchain  
SabiraSeal™ is built using thirdweb smart contract tools, QR-linked NFT authentication, and NRC (Near-Field Communication) technology to establish a next-generation protocol for ownership and provenance tracking.

## 💡 Origin Story

This technology was conceptualized and developed by **Sabira Banfa**, a blockchain-certified fashion entrepreneur and founder of **Sabira Banfa Ateliér**.  
While working as a consultant in the crypto space, she foresaw a gap in the luxury industry: **where is the on-chain proof for $10K bags and one-of-one couture?**  
SabiraSeal™ is the answer.

### 👁️‍🗨️ Global Vision  
This project is designed for globalization, applicable not just to fashion, but high-value collectibles, art, watches, and designer furniture.
